- A Graph is $G=(V, E)$.  A graph $G$ has a set of *vertices* $V$ and a set of *edges* *E*. 
- We define a vertex $v$ and a vertex $u$. Then, we define an edge as $(u,v)$. 
- Adjacency-list representations
- Matrix Representations

- In ==***Weighted Graphs***==, each *edge* has an associated weight function $w: E -> \mathbb{R}$.
- For a given graph $G = (V, E)$ we associate a weight function.
